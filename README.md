# SMART SCROLL: SNAPS TO CONTENT #

Use a single scroll bar to:

* Scroll a whole page until the main content is reached
* Make the main content "sticky" and 1 viewport high:
  + Scroll the main content to the end without scrolling the page
  + Show a non-scrolling aside
* Scroll the whole page again when the main content is
  scrolled to the end to show the footer
